# PhotoTell
This web page is made for a class project.
It does not function.
So, this page will tell how the page should work.
There is a menu on the top right. When you click on the buttons there, it should take you to the related parts of the project.
Profile button on the menu will never going to work because it was a part of the early imaginations of the project.
In the Stories part, there are 3 photos with the 'Read This Story' buttons below them. When you click on the button, it should take you to the page where you can read the story.
On the News part, there are 3 news about photography.
On the Reviews part, there is a review of a SLR camera. When you click to 'Read More' button, it should take you the page where you can read the rest of the review.
And there is contact form at the bottom. You can write in it, but it will not work.
